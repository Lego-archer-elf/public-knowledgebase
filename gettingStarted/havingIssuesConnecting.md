Hm. Here are a few things that come to mind right off the bat:

This might sound a little simple, but double-check that you're connecting to the **correct server IP:** `play.craftingforchrist.net` or `bedrock.craftingforchrist.net`. Typos happen to everyone.

Make sure your **internet connection is stable**. Can you visit other internet websites in your browser? Some **parental controls** block internet access on multiple or all applications – could this apply to you?

**Minecraft logins might be down, or we could be experiencing issues.** If our servers are in a tough spot, we’ll do our best to keep everyone updated on [our Discord server](https://craftingforchrist.net/discord). You can check whether Minecraft is having issues at [Mojang’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/mojangsupport).

You might have been banned from the server (oops), or maybe your IP address is blocked for some reason. There could be a lot of reasons behind this (example: maybe your IP address is be associated to a set of bot accounts that we were attempting to block). Reach out to a Staff Member, and they'll get someone to look into what's going on.
