# Where does my money go?
Any money directed towards Crafting For Christ will primarily go towards the costs to maintain and run the Servers. 

In addition to server costs, money may also go towards Social Media advertising, giveaways and in the future Developers whom make the server possible.

By purchasing anything from Crafting For Christ you are helping us keep the servers up and running!
