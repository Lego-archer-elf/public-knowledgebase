There are two kinds of bugs in this world: bugs that aren’t too serious, and bugs that could cause us real harm if revealed to the public or if in the wrong hands.

If you believe you’ve found a harmful, dangerous bug, please reach out to a Staff Member in private, or email us at support@craftingforchrist.net.

If the bug isn’t too nasty, then you’re welcome to document it on our current [GitHub Bugs repository](https://craftingforchrist.net/issues). Do search through the list of currently open & known bugs first, to make sure yours hasn't already been documented.
