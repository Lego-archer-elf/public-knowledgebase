To start, place a chest on the ground.

Next, place a sign 1 block away from the chest.

*For example in this screenshot it has been placed above the chest.*

On the sign above the chest, write a format of the following:

*(Fig 1) This format is an example for buying and selling an item.*

*(Fig 2) This format is an example for just selling an item.*

You know if you have created a shop successfully if you get a message along the lines of "Shop successfully created!" in chat.

# I am having issues what to call my shop item.
If you are having issues what to call an item on the sign in your shop, use the /iteminfo command to figure out what the name of the item is and also what to put on the shop sign, as seen below.

*In this example Dirt is being used the item and the name of the item to be used on the Shop Sign.*

# Shop Sign Breakdown
The first line will be your username.

The second line is the amount of items to buy or sell per transaction.

For example in Fig 1: Buying 1 Diamond for $10 and selling 1 Diamond for $5

The third line is a combination of buy and sell prices. You need to have a price indicator (like `B` - price that will apply to items bought by users and `S` - the sell price) near the price, the prices are separated by a colon :

The forth line will hold the id/name of the item.

Note: If you get stuck with this you can write a `?` on the sign and the item will be auto filled with the one from the chest or you can click on the sign with the item afterwards.
